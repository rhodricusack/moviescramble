To set up conda environment use
conda create --name moviescramble --file requirements.txt

You also need ffmpeg and ffprobe, on Ubuntu 18.04 
sudo snap install ffmpeg
(which I think should also install ffprobe, but check and correct this README if necessary!)

moviescramble.py Scrambles one or more movies.
